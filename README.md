# _Anaconda_ Martial Arts Academy

_Anaconda_ Martial Arts Academy is a local school of martial arts located in Dublin 15, that teaches a combination of disciplines necessary to become a Mixed Martial Artist.
The goal of the academy however is not to train competition ready athletes but to help their members to get active and fit and receive all benefits of martial arts training, including building self-esteem and confidence.
The classes tought in the academy are: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Kickboxing and Boxing and also MMA for the more advanced students.
Members can practice one chosen discipline or get involved with the whole MMA suite of disciplines.
The school accepts new members across all ages (in BJJ classes, kids can start as early as the age of 4) and various skill levels from Beginners to Advanced.
As 'Anaconda' academy is growing in members, they want to redesign their existing website and bring it up to todays standards in terms of look, responsiveness, user experience and SEO.
